# Bug Fix Summary: Toast Notifications and Biometric Login Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Toast Notification Problems
- **Issue**: Toast notifications not working properly in PWA/mobile scenarios
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proper app visibility handling and network state management
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `usePWAVisibilityHandling()` hook in `App.tsx`
  - Enhanced network connectivity handling with proper toast notifications
  - Added PWA app state recovery when app becomes visible after being backgrounded

### 2. Biometric Login Authentication Issues
- **Issue**: Biometric authentication failing with poor error messages and auth state problems
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Incomplete auth state management in `useAuth.tsx`
  - Generic error messages in biometric setup
  - Missing session validation and initialization
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced `useAuth.tsx` with proper auth state initialization
  - Added comprehensive error handling and state recovery
  - Improved biometric setup error messages to be more user-friendly
  - Fixed auth session management for PWA/mobile scenarios

### 3. Supabase Client Configuration
- **Issue**: Missing auth state validation and PWA support
- **Root Cause**: Basic Supabase client configuration without proper debugging and validation
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced Supabase client with proper auth configuration
  - Added `validateAuthState()` helper function
  - Added `waitForAuth()` for better auth initialization
  - Added debug logging for development environment
  - Improved auth flow with PKCE for security

### 4. Import Error
- **Issue**: Build failing due to incorrect import path in `CSVUpload.tsx`
- **Root Cause**: Wrong import path for Supabase client
- **Fix**: Updated import to use correct path from `@/integrations/supabase/client`
